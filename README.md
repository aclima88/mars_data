3. Created a Beautiful Soup object and used it to extract all of the text elements from the content_title and article_teaser_body classes of the website.

4. Create an empty list to store the dictionaries that I created to hold the title and preview pairs of information for each individual news article in the website. 
    a. Looped the website and collected the title and preview info for each news article.
    b. Stored it into individual dictionaries.
    c. Appended the dictionaries into the empty list created at the start.
